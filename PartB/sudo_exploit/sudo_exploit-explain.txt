Please provide an explanation about how you construct your solution (the program name):


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart1)

I write 4 bytes starting at [0x0805c7ff, 0x0805c800, 0x0805c801, 0x0805c802], as 0x0805c800 is the starting address to `uid` in struct `user_details`.

```shell
(gdb) p &user_details
$1 = (struct user_details *) 0x805c800 <user_details>
(gdb) p user_details
$2 = {uid = 0, euid = 0, gid = 0, egid = 0, username = 0x805dc15 "root",
  cwd = 0x805dd14 "/home/student/A2/PartB/sudo_exploit", tty = 0x805dd44 "/dev/pts/0", host = 0x805dd65 "debian",
  shell = 0x805dc20 "/bin/bash", groups = 0x805dce0, ngroups = 1, ts_cols = 118, ts_lines = 45}
(gdb) ptype user_details.uid
type = unsigned
```
(Note: I could not write at 0x805c800, as I encountered this error `warning: command substitution: ignored null byte in input`.)



- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart2)






- Did you meet the problem that addresses inside/outside GDB are different? Is that a problem or how did you overcome it?

No.
